            <span>Basic to complex shapes</span>
            <p>One of the very first steps as a sketcher is simplifying very complicated shapes 
                into manageable chunks. Artists often struggle with hands, thus, just like the 
                previous example, the fingers are imagined as rectangles except softened 
                into oblongs as shown into the image of the right signifying fingers compressing.

            <span>Shapes and personality</span>
            <p>
                With shapes, it makes it easier to sketch and visualize. As well as check anatomy and proportions.
                 Also, it is much easier to determine the personality of each character from its shapes.

            <span>Caricatures</span>
            <p>
                A caricature are often visual representations of a person that is drawn into an exagerration or a 
                humorous manner. They are often used to provoke or have a commentary based on the subject they are
                 describing.

            <span>Shapes and personality</span>
            <p>
                Some character design techniques gave off vibes thanks to the shape 
                they are designed from. For example, rounded shapes gave off rounded 
                characters, which gave off a well rounded personality 
                such as innocence, square-ish characters gave off dependability, etc.

            <span>Body language</span>
            <p>
                With regards to body language, there is a mixture of shapes to be mixed into it. 
                For example, a mixture of square ish and round shapes combines the two personalities 
                which is approachability and roundness which is inclined to friendliness, a mix of 
                square-ish, triangle and circular shapes give the character confidence, approachability 
                and completeness, etc.

            <span>Satire appealing to popularity</span>
            <p>
                Appealing to memes and other pop culture. One of the many strategies of cartoonists 
                in the modern age is to combine memes and a traditional style in order to communicate 
                and appeal to younger generations especially gen Z. One of many examples is the "bronze medal" 
                meme in which somehow captures the feeling of filipino pride in some circumstances.

                One of the examples is the "this is fine" meme which somewhat 
                represents the vibe of the title, filipino resilience which depicts the pinoy being 
                unaware of his surroundings through resilience.

            <span>Quick trivia</span>
            <p>
                A little bit of trivia. Thomas Nast, who is sometimes called the "Father of the American Cartoon." 
                Nast pitched a campaign via cartoon to expose William M. “Boss” Tweed, and his corrupt Democratic
                 New York City political machine known as Tammany Hall. Nast’s drawings rendered the Boss’ portly figure,
                  tweedy suit, and signature diamond stickpin, with a sack of money in place of his head. Tweed’s giant 
                  figure towered over police who couldn’t touch him. This drawing made Nast a threat claiming that 
                  "damn, my constituents can read pictures."
